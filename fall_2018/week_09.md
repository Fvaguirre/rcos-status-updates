## Last Week's Accomplishments
> I kinda went ahead of myself. I decided to begin implementing the ETA computation in python/flask. I have yet to put through my pull request for the history endpoint.

## This Week's Plan
> Do a pull request in order to get the history endpoint up and live. 

## Anything Blocking?
> I have a very busy week, again.

## Notes
> I did not add an update during the week of Thanksgiving break because I decided to relax during the short break. :)
