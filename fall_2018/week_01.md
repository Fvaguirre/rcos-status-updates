## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I sorted my schedule and got the shuttle tracker environement installed on my system.

## This Week's Plan
> Looking to work on ETA so look at graph algorithms using historical data to predice eta.

## Anything Blocking?

> I still don't know how far into developement the ETA is or if the branch associated with it is still running on the outdated mongoDB.
