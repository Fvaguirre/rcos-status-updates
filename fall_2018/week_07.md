## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I reviewed Yutong's code but we decided to redo it. Her code did not take into consideration the potential format of dividing the route into straight line segments. I have been bogged down with other work, so I have not been able to do much this week. I did, however, get the new frontend and shuttletracker installed on my system.

## This Week's Plan
> I plan on actually testing and then commiting my endpoint code this weekend. 

## Anything Blocking?
> I haven't really tested the endpoint because of a lack of local data. I will try to make mock data this weekend.
