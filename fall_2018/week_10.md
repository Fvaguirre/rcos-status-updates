## Last Week's Accomplishments
> I finally did the pull request for the history endpoint. I still haven't been able to merge it with master because of some Travis Build Errors.
> I reached out on the merge page comments for help on how to fix the conflict, but have yet to hear back.
## This Week's Plan
> I will continue to implement the average speed calculation algorithm in python. Then I will work on getting the route segmentation algorithm working.
## Anything Blocking?
>  End of the year means a lot of work :'(
## Notes
> NONE
