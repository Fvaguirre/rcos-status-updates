## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I looked into Uber's ETA algorithm, but a lot of its details are not made public. I started looking into public Research papers on the matter of ETA algorithms, most of the algorithms don't particularly apply to moving vehicles; they instead look at ETA for file downloads/uploads. Didn't really get the endpoint written since I don't know if I need it yet.

## This Week's Plan
> Do some more research to better understand how I will implement an ETA algorithm.

## Anything Blocking?

> I don't really know who else in RCOS Shuttle tracker is also working on ETAs or if they have anything to contribute at this point in time.

## Notes
> This was pushed in week 04, even though it is what happened last week.
