## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Wrote implementation for historical data endpoint. Waiting on the other ETA group member to review the code and push it to a new ETA branch. Worked a bit more on informing Yutong (my other ETA group member on the alogrithm/process to get ETAs going).

## This Week's Plan
> Finalize historical data endpoint. Make new ETA branch in Shuttle Tracker repo. Push to new branch.

## Anything Blocking?

>  Trying to coordinate Yutong on what to do is a bit challenging, but we are both getting better at communicating with each other

## Notes
> NONE
