## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Wrote history endopoint (as of now it is still the updates url) but it instead should be showing 30 days of updates data. I have yet to be able to test the code since ShuttleTracker has just gone through a frontend change. Yutong (another ETA member) also wrote some code that finds the distance from stop to stop. She has sent it to me and I plan on reviewing it.

## This Week's Plan
> Reinstalling the new shuttletracker frontend and getting it running on my system. After I get it up and running I can go ahead and test my endpoint. I will also be reviewing Yutong's code.

## Anything Blocking?
> I haven't got the shuttletracker up and running yet. Additionally, the lack of 30 days worth of updates data makes it hard to test the new endpoint. I will have to come up with fake update data.
