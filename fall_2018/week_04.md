## Last Week's Accomplishments
> I found what I was looking for! I found a research paper that documents the math and theory behind implementing an ETA system for a bus route in India. The paper does not give any implementation and instead gives only insight on theory, but it is a starting point! I am gonna model my implementation after this paper. I have begun writing up my slides for my group's presentation in small group meeting/large group meeting this Friday. I also figured out that I will need the historical data endpoint for this implementation.

## This Week's Plan
> Start writing the new endpoint and create new branch in github. 

## Anything Blocking?

>  It's kind of hard to coordinate with the other member working on ETAs, I am in the process of filling her in on the implementation/plan for the semester.

## Notes
> NONE
