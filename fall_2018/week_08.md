## Last Week's Accomplishments

> The history endpoint is up and running! After manipulating shuttle Tracker's API, I have finally got it to write the last thirty days of update data to https://shuttles.rpi.edu/history. The endpoint is not yet running on the live shuttle tracker, instead it is simply running on my local server.

## This Week's Plan
> Do a pull request in order to get the history endpoint up and live. Also decide how to better model the classes/functions that will be calculated the ETAs.

## Anything Blocking?
> I have a very busy week. RIP

## Notes
> NONE
