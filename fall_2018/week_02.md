## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Figured out that I should make a new endpoint in the shuttle tracker url that displays more historical tracking data.

## This Week's Plan
> Gonna start working on creating that endpoint and pushing it to github. After finishing said endpoint, I'll research graph algorithms to predict ETA.

## Anything Blocking?

> Time-wise I have been swamped. Additionally, I don't really know how I will implement my ETA/graph Algorithm.

## Notes
> I'm looking to get eh endpoint written by sunday this weekend.
