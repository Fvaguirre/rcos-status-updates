## Last Week's Accomplishments
* Began writing the algorithm documentation for ETAs
* Delegated work to the rest of the ETA team
* While delving into documentation and algorithm perspective, ran into some questions about data structure implementation of the feature
* More specifically, a graph data structure may not be needed since each individual route is linear in terms of branching.


## This Week's Plan
* Iron out algorithm implementation in terms of data structures and specifics
* Will probably not have documentation completely finished

## Anything Blocking?
* Deciding how to store stop/nodes (what data structure to use)

## Notes
* One member of ETA is working on calculating distances and averages
* Another is testing heuristics on average velocity calculations
