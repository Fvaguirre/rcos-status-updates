## Last Week
* I fixed a frontend bug in the vue.js notifications file.
* The bug added a '.' to the end of the notification without checking if the notification text already had a period in it. 
* I went over Sid's ETA.go code to better understand its implementation.


## This Week
* I will see if I can cache my history endpoints json request.
* As it currently stands it takes a looong time for it to query the db for the required 30 day history wall of text
* I will look into caching it in memory


## Blocks
* None presently
