# Last Week
* Read through new ETA Go code pushed by Sid
* Worked on the final few py scripts:
	* These include stops.go, routes.go
* These scripts are the last bit of work towards python ETAs
* This is because of the Go implementation that is already live

# This Week
* Plan on adding documentation to Go implementation 
* Will add comments to functions and code

# Blocking
* This week's workload
